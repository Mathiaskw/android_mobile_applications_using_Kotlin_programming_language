# android_mobile_applications_using_Kotlin_programming_language
This is my study and practice repo for Kotlin android Development
Am perfecting the skill. i have been able to learn from basic concepts upto some advanced kotlin features such as using android jetpack library, kotlin coroutines, viewbinding, Databinding, viewModels, sharedViewmodels, Fragments, SQL, SQLlite, ROOM, DAO, and currently am perfecting using room with repositories to improve user experience in case of a poor network connection and for instances where the app may not be able to retrieve data from the internet
Kotlin is a good and easy language to use despite the fact that i didn't learn Java first, but when i make comparisons, the lines of code written in Java are too many compared to those written using Kotlin for the same project
